(ns tensorflow-estimator.python.estimator.api.-v1.estimator.Head
  "Interface for the head/top of a model.

  Head sits on top of the model network and handles computing the outputs of
  the network. Given logits (or output of a hidden layer), a Head knows how to
  compute predictions, loss, train_op, metrics and export outputs. It is meant
  to:

  1. Simplify writing model_fn and to make model_fn more configurable for
     Estimator.
  2. Simpilfy creating loss and metrics for the train and test loop in Eager
     execution.
  3. Support wide range of machine learning models. Since most heads can work
     with logits, they can support DNN, RNN, Wide, Wide&Deep,
     Global objectives, Gradient boosted trees and many other types
     of machine learning models.

  Common usage:
  Here is simplified model_fn to build a DNN regression model.
    ```python
    def _my_dnn_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params, config=None):
      # Optionally your callers can pass head to model_fn as a param.
      head = tf.estimator.RegressionHead(...)

      # TODO(b/117839674): update feature_column
      inputs = tf.feature_column.input_layer(features, ...)

      # Compute logits with tf.keras.layers API

          units=1000, activation=\"relu\")(inputs)
      hidden_layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(

      logits = tf.keras.layers.Dense(

(defn create-estimator-spec 
  "Returns `EstimatorSpec` that a model_fn can return.

    It is recommended to pass all args via name.

    Args:
      features: Input `dict` mapping string feature names to `Tensor` or
        `SparseTensor` objects containing the values for that feature in a
        minibatch. Often to be used to fetch example-weight tensor.
      mode: Estimator's `ModeKeys`.
      logits: Logits `Tensor` to be used by the head.
      labels: Labels `Tensor`, or `dict` mapping string label names to `Tensor`
        objects of the label values.
      optimizer: An `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` instance to optimize the
        loss in TRAIN mode. Namely, sets `train_op = optimizer.get_updates(loss,
        trainable_variables)`, which updates variables to minimize `loss`.
      trainable_variables: A list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to
        minimize `loss`. In Tensorflow 1.x, by default these are the list of
        variables collected in the graph under the key
        `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`. As Tensorflow 2.x doesn't have
        collections and GraphKeys, trainable_variables need to be passed
        explicitly here.
      train_op_fn: Function that takes a scalar loss `Tensor` and returns an op
        to optimize the model with the loss in TRAIN mode. Used if `optimizer`
        is `None`. Exactly one of `train_op_fn` and `optimizer` must be set in
        TRAIN mode. By default, it is `None` in other modes. If you want to
        optimize loss yourself, you can pass `lambda _: tf.no_op()` and then use
        `EstimatorSpec.loss` to compute and apply gradients.
      update_ops: A list or tuple of update ops to be run at training time. For
        example, layers such as BatchNormalization create mean and variance
        update ops that need to be run at training time. In Tensorflow 1.x,
        these are thrown into an UPDATE_OPS collection. As Tensorflow 2.x
        doesn't have collections, update_ops need to be passed explicitly here.
      regularization_losses: A list of additional scalar losses to be added to
        the training loss, such as regularization losses.

    Returns:
      `EstimatorSpec`.
