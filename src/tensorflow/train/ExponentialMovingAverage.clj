(ns tensorflow.train.ExponentialMovingAverage
  "Maintains moving averages of variables by employing an exponential decay.

  When training a model, it is often beneficial to maintain moving averages of
  the trained parameters.  Evaluations that use averaged parameters sometimes
  produce significantly better results than the final trained values.

  The `apply()` method adds shadow copies of trained variables and add ops that
  maintain a moving average of the trained variables in their shadow copies.
  It is used when building the training model.  The ops that maintain moving
  averages are typically run after each training step.
  The `average()` and `average_name()` methods give access to the shadow
  variables and their names.  They are useful when building an evaluation
  model, or when restoring a model from a checkpoint file.  They help use the
  moving averages in place of the last trained values for evaluations.

  The moving averages are computed using exponential decay.  You specify the
  decay value when creating the `ExponentialMovingAverage` object.  The shadow
  variables are initialized with the same initial values as the trained
  variables.  When you run the ops to maintain the moving averages, each
  shadow variable is updated with the formula:

    `shadow_variable -= (1 - decay) * (shadow_variable - variable)`

  This is mathematically equivalent to the classic formula below, but the use
  of an `assign_sub` op (the `\"-=\"` in the formula) allows concurrent lockless
  updates to the variables:

    `shadow_variable = decay * shadow_variable + (1 - decay) * variable`

  Reasonable values for `decay` are close to 1.0, typically in the
  multiple-nines range: 0.999, 0.9999, etc.

  Example usage when creating a training model:

  ```python
  # Create variables.
  var0 = tf.Variable(...)
  var1 = tf.Variable(...)
  # ... use the variables to build a training model...
  ...
  # Create an op that applies the optimizer.  This is what we usually
  # would use as a training op.
  opt_op = opt.minimize(my_loss, [var0, var1])

  # Create an ExponentialMovingAverage object
  ema = tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage(decay=0.9999)

  with tf.control_dependencies([opt_op]):
      # Create the shadow variables, and add ops to maintain moving averages
      # of var0 and var1. This also creates an op that will update the moving
      # averages after each training step.  This is what we will use in place
      # of the usual training op.
      training_op = ema.apply([var0, var1])

  ...train the model by running training_op...
  ```

  There are two ways to use the moving averages for evaluations:

  *  Build a model that uses the shadow variables instead of the variables.
     For this, use the `average()` method which returns the shadow variable
     for a given variable.
  *  Build a model normally but load the checkpoint files to evaluate by using
     the shadow variable names.  For this use the `average_name()` method.  See
     the `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver` for more
     information on restoring saved variables.

  Example of restoring the shadow variable values:

  ```python
  # Create a Saver that loads variables from their saved shadow values.
  shadow_var0_name = ema.average_name(var0)
  shadow_var1_name = ema.average_name(var1)
  saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({shadow_var0_name: var0, shadow_var1_name:
  var1})
  saver.restore(...checkpoint filename...)
  # var0 and var1 now hold the moving average values
  ```

(defn apply 
  "Maintains moving averages of variables.

    `var_list` must be a list of `Variable` or `Tensor` objects.  This method
    creates shadow variables for all elements of `var_list`.  Shadow variables
    for `Variable` objects are initialized to the variable's initial value.
    They will be added to the `GraphKeys.MOVING_AVERAGE_VARIABLES` collection.
    For `Tensor` objects, the shadow variables are initialized to 0 and zero
    debiased (see docstring in `assign_moving_average` for more details).

    shadow variables are created with `trainable=False` and added to the
    `GraphKeys.ALL_VARIABLES` collection.  They will be returned by calls to
    `tf.compat.v1.global_variables()`.

    Returns an op that updates all shadow variables from the current value of
    their associated variables.

    Note that `apply()` can be called multiple times. When eager execution is
    enabled each call to apply will update the variables once, so this needs to
    be called in a loop.

    Args:
      var_list: A list of Variable or Tensor objects. The variables and Tensors
        must be of types bfloat16, float16, float32, or float64.

    Returns:
      An Operation that updates the moving averages.

    The typical scenario for `ExponentialMovingAverage` is to compute moving
    averages of variables during training, and restore the variables from the
    computed moving averages during evaluations.

    To restore variables, you have to know the name of the shadow variables.
    That name and the original variable can then be passed to a `Saver()` object
    to restore the variable from the moving average value with:
      `saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({ema.average_name(var): var})`

    `average_name()` can be called whether or not `apply()` has been called.

    Args:
      var: A `Variable` object.

    Returns:
      A string: The name of the variable that will be used or was used
      by the `ExponentialMovingAverage class` to hold the moving average of
      `var`.
