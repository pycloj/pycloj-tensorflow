  "The Laplace distribution with location `loc` and `scale` parameters.

  #### Mathematical details

  The probability density function (pdf) of this distribution is,

  ```none
  pdf(x; mu, sigma) = exp(-|x - mu| / sigma) / Z
  Z = 2 sigma
  ```

  where `loc = mu`, `scale = sigma`, and `Z` is the normalization constant.

  Note that the Laplace distribution can be thought of two exponential
  distributions spliced together \"back-to-back.\"

  The Lpalce distribution is a member of the [location-scale family](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-scale_family), i.e., it can be
  constructed as,

  ```none
  X ~ Laplace(loc=0, scale=1)

    Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a

    the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is
    undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for
    Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or -
