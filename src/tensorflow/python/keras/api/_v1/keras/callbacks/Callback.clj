      model: instance of `keras.models.Model`.

  The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
  take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
  the current batch or epoch.

  Currently, the `.fit()` method of the `Model` class
  will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
  it passes to its callbacks:

      on_epoch_end: logs include `acc` and `loss`, and
          optionally include `val_loss`
          (if validation is enabled in `fit`), and `val_acc`
          (if validation and accuracy monitoring are enabled).
      on_batch_begin: logs include `size`,
          the number of samples in the current batch.
      on_batch_end: logs include `loss`, and optionally `acc`
          (if accuracy monitoring is enabled).
