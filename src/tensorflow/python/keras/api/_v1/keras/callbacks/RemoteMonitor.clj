  "Callback used to stream events to a server.

  Requires the `requests` library.
  Events are sent to `root + '/publish/epoch/end/'` by default. Calls are
  HTTP POST, with a `data` argument which is a
  JSON-encoded dictionary of event data.
  If send_as_json is set to True, the content type of the request will be
  application/json. Otherwise the serialized JSON will be sent within a form.

  Arguments:
      root: String; root url of the target server.
      path: String; path relative to `root` to which the events will be sent.
      field: String; JSON field under which the data will be stored.
          The field is used only if the payload is sent within a form
          (i.e. send_as_json is set to False).
      headers: Dictionary; optional custom HTTP headers.
      send_as_json: Boolean; whether the request should be
          sent as application/json.
