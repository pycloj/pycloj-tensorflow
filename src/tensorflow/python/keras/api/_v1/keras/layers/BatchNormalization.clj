(ns tensorflow.python.keras.api.-v1.keras.layers.BatchNormalization
  "Base class of Batch normalization layer (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2014).

  Normalize the activations of the previous layer at each batch,
  i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation
  close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1.

  Arguments:
    axis: Integer, the axis that should be normalized
      (typically the features axis).
      For instance, after a `Conv2D` layer with
      `data_format=\"channels_first\"`,
      set `axis=1` in `BatchNormalization`.
    momentum: Momentum for the moving average.
    epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
    center: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor.
      If False, `beta` is ignored.
    scale: If True, multiply by `gamma`.
      If False, `gamma` is not used.
      When the next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`),
      this can be disabled since the scaling
      will be done by the next layer.
    beta_initializer: Initializer for the beta weight.
    gamma_initializer: Initializer for the gamma weight.
    moving_mean_initializer: Initializer for the moving mean.
    moving_variance_initializer: Initializer for the moving variance.
    beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
    gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
    beta_constraint: Optional constraint for the beta weight.
    gamma_constraint: Optional constraint for the gamma weight.
    renorm: Whether to use Batch Renormalization
      (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03275). This adds extra variables during
      training. The inference is the same for either value of this parameter.
    renorm_clipping: A dictionary that may map keys 'rmax', 'rmin', 'dmax' to
      scalar `Tensors` used to clip the renorm correction. The correction
      `(r, d)` is used as `corrected_value = normalized_value * r + d`, with
      `r` clipped to [rmin, rmax], and `d` to [-dmax, dmax]. Missing rmax, rmin,
      dmax are set to inf, 0, inf, respectively.
    renorm_momentum: Momentum used to update the moving means and standard
      deviations with renorm. Unlike `momentum`, this affects training
      and should be neither too small (which would add noise) nor too large
      (which would give stale estimates). Note that `momentum` is still applied
      to get the means and variances for inference.
    fused: if `True`, use a faster, fused implementation, or raise a ValueError
      if the fused implementation cannot be used. If `None`, use the faster
      implementation if possible. If False, do not used the fused
      implementation.
    trainable: Boolean, if `True` the variables will be marked as trainable.
    virtual_batch_size: An `int`. By default, `virtual_batch_size` is `None`,
      which means batch normalization is performed across the whole batch. When
      `virtual_batch_size` is not `None`, instead perform \"Ghost Batch
      Normalization\", which creates virtual sub-batches which are each
      normalized separately (with shared gamma, beta, and moving statistics).
      Must divide the actual batch size during execution.
    adjustment: A function taking the `Tensor` containing the (dynamic) shape of
      the input tensor and returning a pair (scale, bias) to apply to the
      normalized values (before gamma and beta), only during training. For
      example, if axis==-1,
        `adjustment = lambda shape: (
          tf.random.uniform(shape[-1:], 0.93, 1.07),
          tf.random.uniform(shape[-1:], -0.1, 0.1))`
      will scale the normalized value by up to 7% up or down, then shift the
      result by up to 0.1 (with independent scaling and bias for each feature
      but shared across all examples), and finally apply gamma and/or beta. If
      `None`, no adjustment is applied. Cannot be specified if
      virtual_batch_size is specified.

  Call arguments:
    inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode.
      - `training=True`: The layer will normalize its inputs using the
        mean and variance of the current batch of inputs.
      - `training=False`: The layer will normalize its inputs using the
        mean and variance of its moving statistics, learned during training.

  Input shape:
    Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape`
    (tuple of integers, does not include the samples axis)
    when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

  Output shape:
    Same shape as input.

  "Optional regularizer function for the output of this layer."

(defn add-loss 
  "Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

    Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
    on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same
    layer on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may
    be dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
    of dependencies.

    This method can be used inside a subclassed layer or model's `call`
    function, in which case `losses` should be a Tensor or list of Tensors.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def call(inputs, self):
        self.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(inputs)), inputs=True)
        return inputs
    ```

    This method can also be called directly on a Functional Model during
    construction. In this case, any loss Tensors passed to this Model must
    be symbolic and be able to be traced back to the model's `Input`s. These
    losses become part of the model's topology and are tracked in `get_config`.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Actvity regularization.
    model.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(x)))
    ```

    If this is not the case for your loss (if, for example, your loss references
    a `Variable` of one of the model's layers), you can wrap your loss in a
    zero-argument lambda. These losses are not tracked as part of the model's
    topology since they can't be serialized.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Weight regularization.
    model.add_loss(lambda: tf.reduce_mean(x.kernel))
    ```

    The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
    specific set of inputs.

    Arguments:
      losses: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors. Rather than tensors, losses
        may also be zero-argument callables which create a loss tensor.
      inputs: Ignored when executing eagerly. If anything other than None is
        passed, it signals the losses are conditional on some of the layer's
        inputs, and thus they should only be run where these inputs are
        available. This is the case for activity regularization losses, for
        instance. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
        to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
        (e.g. weight regularization losses).

        `model.add_metric(bin_acc(y_true, y_pred))`. If aggregation='mean', the
