(ns tensorflow.python.keras.api.-v1.keras.layers.RNN
  "Base class for recurrent layers.

  Arguments:
    cell: A RNN cell instance or a list of RNN cell instances.
      A RNN cell is a class that has:
      - A `call(input_at_t, states_at_t)` method, returning
        `(output_at_t, states_at_t_plus_1)`. The call method of the
        cell can also take the optional argument `constants`, see
        section \"Note on passing external constants\" below.
      - A `state_size` attribute. This can be a single integer
        (single state) in which case it is the size of the recurrent
        state. This can also be a list/tuple of integers (one size per
        state).
        The `state_size` can also be TensorShape or tuple/list of
        TensorShape, to represent high dimension state.
      - A `output_size` attribute. This can be a single integer or a
        TensorShape, which represent the shape of the output. For backward
        compatible reason, if this attribute is not available for the
        cell, the value will be inferred by the first element of the
        `state_size`.
      - A `get_initial_state(inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None)`
        method that creates a tensor meant to be fed to `call()` as the
        initial state, if the user didn't specify any initial state via other
        means. The returned initial state should have a shape of
        [batch_size, cell.state_size]. The cell might choose to create a
        tensor full of zeros, or full of other values based on the cell's
        implementation.
        `inputs` is the input tensor to the RNN layer, which should
        contain the batch size as its shape[0], and also dtype. Note that
        the shape[0] might be `None` during the graph construction. Either
        the `inputs` or the pair of `batch_size` and `dtype` are provided.
        `batch_size` is a scalar tensor that represents the batch size
        of the inputs. `dtype` is `tf.DType` that represents the dtype of
        the inputs.
        For backward compatible reason, if this method is not implemented
        by the cell, the RNN layer will create a zero filled tensor with the
        size of [batch_size, cell.state_size].
      In the case that `cell` is a list of RNN cell instances, the cells
      will be stacked on top of each other in the RNN, resulting in an
      efficient stacked RNN.
    return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
      in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
    return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
      in addition to the output.
    go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
      If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the
      reversed sequence.
    stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
      for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
      state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
    unroll: Boolean (default False).
      If True, the network will be unrolled, else a symbolic loop will be used.
      Unrolling can speed-up a RNN,
      although it tends to be more memory-intensive.
      Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` tensors.
      If True, the inputs and outputs will be in shape
      `(timesteps, batch, ...)`, whereas in the False case, it will be
      `(batch, timesteps, ...)`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more
      efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the
      RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by
      default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major
      form.

  Call arguments:
    inputs: Input tensor.
    mask: Binary tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps)` indicating whether
      a given timestep should be masked.
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell
      when calling it. This is for use with cells that use dropout.
    initial_state: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first
      call of the cell.
    constants: List of constant tensors to be passed to the cell at each
      timestep.

  Input shape:
    N-D tensor with shape `(batch_size, timesteps, ...)` or
    `(timesteps, batch_size, ...)` when time_major is True.

  Output shape:
    - If `return_state`: a list of tensors. The first tensor is
      the output. The remaining tensors are the last states,
      each with shape `(batch_size, state_size)`, where `state_size` could
      be a high dimension tensor shape.
    - If `return_sequences`: N-D tensor with shape
      `(batch_size, timesteps, output_size)`, where `output_size` could
      be a high dimension tensor shape, or
      `(timesteps, batch_size, output_size)` when `time_major` is True.
    - Else, N-D tensor with shape `(batch_size, output_size)`, where
      `output_size` could be a high dimension tensor shape.

  Masking:
    This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number
    of timesteps. To introduce masks to your data,
    use an [Embedding](embeddings.md) layer with the `mask_zero` parameter
    set to `True`.

  Note on using statefulness in RNNs:
    You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful', which means that the states
    computed for the samples in one batch will be reused as initial states
    for the samples in the next batch. This assumes a one-to-one mapping
    between samples in different successive batches.

    To enable statefulness:
      - Specify `stateful=True` in the layer constructor.
      - Specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing
        If sequential model:
          `batch_input_shape=(...)` to the first layer in your model.
        Else for functional model with 1 or more Input layers:
          `batch_shape=(...)` to all the first layers in your model.
        This is the expected shape of your inputs
        *including the batch size*.
        It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100)`.
      - Specify `shuffle=False` when calling fit().

    To reset the states of your model, call `.reset_states()` on either
    a specific layer, or on your entire model.

  Note on specifying the initial state of RNNs:
    You can specify the initial state of RNN layers symbolically by
    calling them with the keyword argument `initial_state`. The value of
    `initial_state` should be a tensor or list of tensors representing
    the initial state of the RNN layer.

    You can specify the initial state of RNN layers numerically by
    calling `reset_states` with the keyword argument `states`. The value of
    `states` should be a numpy array or list of numpy arrays representing
    the initial state of the RNN layer.

  Note on passing external constants to RNNs:
    You can pass \"external\" constants to the cell using the `constants`
    keyword argument of `RNN.__call__` (as well as `RNN.call`) method. This
    requires that the `cell.call` method accepts the same keyword argument
    `constants`. Such constants can be used to condition the cell
    transformation on additional static inputs (not changing over time),
    a.k.a. an attention mechanism.

  ```python
  # First, let's define a RNN Cell, as a layer subclass.

      def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):

(defn add-loss 
  "Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

    Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
    on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same
    layer on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may
    be dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
    of dependencies.

    This method can be used inside a subclassed layer or model's `call`
    function, in which case `losses` should be a Tensor or list of Tensors.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def call(inputs, self):
        self.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(inputs)), inputs=True)
        return inputs
    ```

    This method can also be called directly on a Functional Model during
    construction. In this case, any loss Tensors passed to this Model must
    be symbolic and be able to be traced back to the model's `Input`s. These
    losses become part of the model's topology and are tracked in `get_config`.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Actvity regularization.
    model.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(x)))
    ```

    If this is not the case for your loss (if, for example, your loss references
    a `Variable` of one of the model's layers), you can wrap your loss in a
    zero-argument lambda. These losses are not tracked as part of the model's
    topology since they can't be serialized.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Weight regularization.
    model.add_loss(lambda: tf.reduce_mean(x.kernel))
    ```

    The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
    specific set of inputs.

    Arguments:
      losses: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors. Rather than tensors, losses
        may also be zero-argument callables which create a loss tensor.
      inputs: Ignored when executing eagerly. If anything other than None is
        passed, it signals the losses are conditional on some of the layer's
        inputs, and thus they should only be run where these inputs are
        available. This is the case for activity regularization losses, for
        instance. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
        to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
        (e.g. weight regularization losses).

        Note that `trainable` cannot be `True` if `synchronization`
        is set to `ON_READ`.
      constraint: Constraint instance (callable).
      partitioner: Partitioner to be passed to the `Trackable` API.
      use_resource: Whether to use `ResourceVariable`.
      synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be
        aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
        `tf.VariableSynchronization`. By default the synchronization is set to
        `AUTO` and the current `DistributionStrategy` chooses
        when to synchronize. If `synchronization` is set to `ON_READ`,
        `trainable` must not be set to `True`.
      aggregation: Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.
        Accepted values are constants defined in the class
        `tf.VariableAggregation`.
      **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments. Accepted values are `getter` and
        `collections`.

    Returns:
      The created variable. Usually either a `Variable` or `ResourceVariable`
      instance. If `partitioner` is not `None`, a `PartitionedVariable`
      instance is returned.

    Raises:
      RuntimeError: If called with partitioned variable regularization and
        eager execution is enabled.
      ValueError: When giving unsupported dtype and no initializer or when
