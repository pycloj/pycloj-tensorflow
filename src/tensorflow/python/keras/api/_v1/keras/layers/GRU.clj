  "Gated Recurrent Unit - Cho et al. 2014.

  There are two variants. The default one is based on 1406.1078v3 and
  has reset gate applied to hidden state before matrix multiplication. The
  other one is based on original 1406.1078v1 and has the order reversed.

  The second variant is compatible with CuDNNGRU (GPU-only) and allows
  inference on CPU. Thus it has separate biases for `kernel` and
  `recurrent_kernel`. Use `'reset_after'=True` and
  `recurrent_activation='sigmoid'`.

  Arguments:
    units: Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
    activation: Activation function to use.
      Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`).
      If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
      (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
      for the recurrent step.
      Default: hard sigmoid (`hard_sigmoid`).
      If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
      (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the inputs.
    recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
      weights matrix, used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
    kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the `kernel` weights matrix.
    recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
    bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.
    activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the output of the layer (its \"activation\")..
    kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
      the `kernel` weights matrix.
    recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
      the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
    bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector.
    dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the units to drop for
      the linear transformation of the inputs.
    recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the units to drop for
      the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    implementation: Implementation mode, either 1 or 2.
      Mode 1 will structure its operations as a larger number of
      smaller dot products and additions, whereas mode 2 will
      batch them into fewer, larger operations. These modes will
      have different performance profiles on different hardware and
      for different applications.
    return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
      in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
    return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
      in addition to the output.
    go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
      If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the
      reversed sequence.
    stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
      for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
      state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
    unroll: Boolean (default False).
      If True, the network will be unrolled,
      else a symbolic loop will be used.
      Unrolling can speed-up a RNN,
      although it tends to be more memory-intensive.
      Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` tensors.
      If True, the inputs and outputs will be in shape
      `(timesteps, batch, ...)`, whereas in the False case, it will be
      `(batch, timesteps, ...)`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more
      efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the
      RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by
      default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major
      form. 
    reset_after: GRU convention (whether to apply reset gate after or
      before matrix multiplication). False = \"before\" (default),
      True = \"after\" (CuDNN compatible).

  Call arguments:
    inputs: A 3D tensor.
    mask: Binary tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps)` indicating whether
      a given timestep should be masked.
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell
      when calling it. This is only relevant if `dropout` or
      `recurrent_dropout` is used.
    initial_state: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first
      call of the cell.

(defn add-loss 
  "Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

    Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
    on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same
    layer on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may
    be dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
    of dependencies.

    This method can be used inside a subclassed layer or model's `call`
    function, in which case `losses` should be a Tensor or list of Tensors.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def call(inputs, self):
        self.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(inputs)), inputs=True)
        return inputs
    ```

    This method can also be called directly on a Functional Model during
    construction. In this case, any loss Tensors passed to this Model must
    be symbolic and be able to be traced back to the model's `Input`s. These
    losses become part of the model's topology and are tracked in `get_config`.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Actvity regularization.
    model.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(x)))
    ```

    If this is not the case for your loss (if, for example, your loss references
    a `Variable` of one of the model's layers), you can wrap your loss in a
    zero-argument lambda. These losses are not tracked as part of the model's
    topology since they can't be serialized.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Weight regularization.
    model.add_loss(lambda: tf.reduce_mean(x.kernel))
    ```

    The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
    specific set of inputs.

    Arguments:
      losses: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors. Rather than tensors, losses
        may also be zero-argument callables which create a loss tensor.
      inputs: Ignored when executing eagerly. If anything other than None is
        passed, it signals the losses are conditional on some of the layer's
        inputs, and thus they should only be run where these inputs are
        available. This is the case for activity regularization losses, for
        instance. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
        to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
        (e.g. weight regularization losses).
