(ns tensorflow.python.keras.api.-v1.keras.metrics.Recall
  "Computes the recall of the predictions with respect to the labels.

  For example, if `y_true` is [0, 1, 1, 1] and `y_pred` is [1, 0, 1, 1]
  then the recall value is 2/(2+1) ie. 0.66. If the weights were specified as
  [0, 0, 1, 0] then the recall value would be 1.

  This metric creates two local variables, `true_positives` and
  `false_negatives`, that are used to compute the recall. This value is
  ultimately returned as `recall`, an idempotent operation that simply divides
  `true_positives` by the sum of `true_positives` and `false_negatives`.

  If `sample_weight` is `None`, weights default to 1.
  Use `sample_weight` of 0 to mask values.

  If `top_k` is set, recall will be computed as how often on average a class
  among the labels of a batch entry is in the top-k predictions.

  If `class_id` is specified, we calculate recall by considering only the
  entries in the batch for which `class_id` is in the label, and computing the
  fraction of them for which `class_id` is above the threshold and/or in the
  top-k predictions.

  Usage:

  ```python
  m = tf.keras.metrics.Recall()
  m.update_state([0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1])
  print('Final result: ', m.result().numpy())  # Final result: 0.66

  "Optional regularizer function for the output of this layer."

(defn add-loss 
  "Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

    Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
    on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same
    layer on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may
    be dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
    of dependencies.

    This method can be used inside a subclassed layer or model's `call`
    function, in which case `losses` should be a Tensor or list of Tensors.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def call(inputs, self):
        self.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(inputs)), inputs=True)
        return inputs
    ```

    This method can also be called directly on a Functional Model during
    construction. In this case, any loss Tensors passed to this Model must
    be symbolic and be able to be traced back to the model's `Input`s. These
    losses become part of the model's topology and are tracked in `get_config`.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Actvity regularization.
    model.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(x)))
    ```

    If this is not the case for your loss (if, for example, your loss references
    a `Variable` of one of the model's layers), you can wrap your loss in a
    zero-argument lambda. These losses are not tracked as part of the model's
    topology since they can't be serialized.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Weight regularization.
    model.add_loss(lambda: tf.reduce_mean(x.kernel))
    ```

    The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
    specific set of inputs.

    Arguments:
      losses: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors. Rather than tensors, losses
        may also be zero-argument callables which create a loss tensor.
      inputs: Ignored when executing eagerly. If anything other than None is
        passed, it signals the losses are conditional on some of the layer's
        inputs, and thus they should only be run where these inputs are
        available. This is the case for activity regularization losses, for
        instance. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
        to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
        (e.g. weight regularization losses).

        `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `y_true`, and must
        be broadcastable to `y_true`.

    Returns:
      Update op.
