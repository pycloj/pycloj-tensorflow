(ns tensorflow.initializers.truncated-normal
  "Initializer that generates a truncated normal distribution.

  These values are similar to values from a `random_normal_initializer`
  except that values more than two standard deviations from the mean
  are discarded and re-drawn. This is the recommended initializer for
  neural network weights and filters.

  Args:
    mean: a python scalar or a scalar tensor. Mean of the random values to
      generate.
    stddev: a python scalar or a scalar tensor. Standard deviation of the random
      values to generate.
    seed: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See
      `tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed` for behavior.
    dtype: Default data type, used if no `dtype` argument is provided when
      calling the initializer. Only floating point types are supported.
