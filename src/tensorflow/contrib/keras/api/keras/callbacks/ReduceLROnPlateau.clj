(ns tensorflow.contrib.keras.api.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau
  "Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.

  Models often benefit from reducing the learning rate by a factor
  of 2-10 once learning stagnates. This callback monitors a
  quantity and if no improvement is seen for a 'patience' number
  of epochs, the learning rate is reduced.

  Example:

  ```python
  reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2,
                                patience=5, min_lr=0.001)
  model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[reduce_lr])
  ```

  Arguments:
      monitor: quantity to be monitored.
      factor: factor by which the learning rate will be reduced. new_lr = lr *
        factor
      patience: number of epochs with no improvement after which learning rate
        will be reduced.
      verbose: int. 0: quiet, 1: update messages.
      mode: one of {auto, min, max}. In `min` mode, lr will be reduced when the
        quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in `max` mode it will be
        reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in `auto`
        mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the
        monitored quantity.
      min_delta: threshold for measuring the new optimum, to only focus on
        significant changes.
      cooldown: number of epochs to wait before resuming normal operation after
        lr has been reduced.
      min_lr: lower bound on the learning rate.
