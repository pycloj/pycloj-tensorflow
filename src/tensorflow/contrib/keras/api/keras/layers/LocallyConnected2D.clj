  "Locally-connected layer for 2D inputs.

  The `LocallyConnected2D` layer works similarly
  to the `Conv2D` layer, except that weights are unshared,
  that is, a different set of filters is applied at each
  different patch of the input.

  Examples:
  ```python
      # apply a 3x3 unshared weights convolution with 64 output filters on a
      32x32 image
      # with `data_format=\"channels_last\"`:
      model = Sequential()
      model.add(LocallyConnected2D(64, (3, 3), input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
      # now model.output_shape == (None, 30, 30, 64)
      # notice that this layer will consume (30*30)*(3*3*3*64) + (30*30)*64
      parameters

      # add a 3x3 unshared weights convolution on top, with 32 output filters:
      model.add(LocallyConnected2D(32, (3, 3)))
      # now model.output_shape == (None, 28, 28, 32)
  ```

  Arguments:
      filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
          (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
      kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers, specifying the
          width and height of the 2D convolution window.
          Can be a single integer to specify the same value for
          all spatial dimensions.
      strides: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers,
          specifying the strides of the convolution along the width and height.
          Can be a single integer to specify the same value for
          all spatial dimensions.
      padding: Currently only support `\"valid\"` (case-insensitive).
          `\"same\"` will be supported in future.
      data_format: A string,
          one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
          The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
          `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
          `(batch, height, width, channels)` while `channels_first`
          corresponds to inputs with shape
          `(batch, channels, height, width)`.
          It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
          Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
          If you never set it, then it will be \"channels_last\".
      activation: Activation function to use.
          If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
          (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
          the `kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.
      activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
          the output of the layer (its \"activation\").
      kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to the kernel matrix.
      bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector.
      implementation: implementation mode, either `1`, `2`, or `3`.
          `1` loops over input spatial locations to perform the forward pass.
          It is memory-efficient but performs a lot of (small) ops.

          `2` stores layer weights in a dense but sparsely-populated 2D matrix
          and implements the forward pass as a single matrix-multiply. It uses
          a lot of RAM but performs few (large) ops.

          `3` stores layer weights in a sparse tensor and implements the forward
          pass as a single sparse matrix-multiply.

          How to choose:

          `1`: large, dense models,
          `2`: small models,
          `3`: large, sparse models,

          where \"large\" stands for large input/output activations
          (i.e. many `filters`, `input_filters`, large `np.prod(input_size)`,
          `np.prod(output_size)`), and \"sparse\" stands for few connections
          between inputs and outputs, i.e. small ratio
          `filters * input_filters * np.prod(kernel_size) / (np.prod(input_size)
          * np.prod(strides))`, where inputs to and outputs of the layer are
          assumed to have shapes `input_size + (input_filters,)`,
          `output_size + (filters,)` respectively.

          It is recommended to benchmark each in the setting of interest to pick
          the most efficient one (in terms of speed and memory usage). Correct
          choice of implementation can lead to dramatic speed improvements (e.g.
          50X), potentially at the expense of RAM.

          Also, only `padding=\"valid\"` is supported by `implementation=1`.

  Input shape:
      4D tensor with shape:
      `(samples, channels, rows, cols)` if data_format='channels_first'
      or 4D tensor with shape:
      `(samples, rows, cols, channels)` if data_format='channels_last'.

  Output shape:
      4D tensor with shape:
      `(samples, filters, new_rows, new_cols)` if data_format='channels_first'
      or 4D tensor with shape:
      `(samples, new_rows, new_cols, filters)` if data_format='channels_last'.
      `rows` and `cols` values might have changed due to padding.

(defn add-loss 
  "Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

    Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
    on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same
    layer on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may
    be dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
    of dependencies.

    This method can be used inside a subclassed layer or model's `call`
    function, in which case `losses` should be a Tensor or list of Tensors.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def call(inputs, self):
        self.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(inputs)), inputs=True)
        return inputs
    ```

    This method can also be called directly on a Functional Model during
    construction. In this case, any loss Tensors passed to this Model must
    be symbolic and be able to be traced back to the model's `Input`s. These
    losses become part of the model's topology and are tracked in `get_config`.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Actvity regularization.
    model.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(x)))
    ```

    If this is not the case for your loss (if, for example, your loss references
    a `Variable` of one of the model's layers), you can wrap your loss in a
    zero-argument lambda. These losses are not tracked as part of the model's
    topology since they can't be serialized.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Weight regularization.
    model.add_loss(lambda: tf.reduce_mean(x.kernel))
    ```

    The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
    specific set of inputs.

    Arguments:
      losses: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors. Rather than tensors, losses
        may also be zero-argument callables which create a loss tensor.
      inputs: Ignored when executing eagerly. If anything other than None is
        passed, it signals the losses are conditional on some of the layer's
        inputs, and thus they should only be run where these inputs are
        available. This is the case for activity regularization losses, for
        instance. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
        to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
        (e.g. weight regularization losses).
