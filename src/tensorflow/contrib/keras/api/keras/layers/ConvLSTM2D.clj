  "Convolutional LSTM.

  It is similar to an LSTM layer, but the input transformations
  and recurrent transformations are both convolutional.

  Arguments:
    filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
      (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
    kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying the
      dimensions of the convolution window.
    strides: An integer or tuple/list of n integers,
      specifying the strides of the convolution.
      Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
      any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
    padding: One of `\"valid\"` or `\"same\"` (case-insensitive).
    data_format: A string,
      one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
      The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
      `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
      `(batch, time, ..., channels)`
      while `channels_first` corresponds to
      inputs with shape `(batch, time, channels, ...)`.
      It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
      Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
      If you never set it, then it will be \"channels_last\".
    dilation_rate: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying
      the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.
      Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is
      incompatible with specifying any `strides` value != 1.
    activation: Activation function to use.
      By default hyperbolic tangent activation function is applied
      (`tanh(x)`).
    recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
      for the recurrent step.
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the inputs.
    recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
      weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
    unit_forget_bias: Boolean.
      If True, add 1 to the bias of the forget gate at initialization.
      Use in combination with `bias_initializer=\"zeros\"`.

(defn add-loss 
  "Add loss tensor(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs.

    Some losses (for instance, activity regularization losses) may be dependent
    on the inputs passed when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same
    layer on different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.losses` may
    be dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
    of dependencies.

    This method can be used inside a subclassed layer or model's `call`
    function, in which case `losses` should be a Tensor or list of Tensors.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def call(inputs, self):
        self.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(inputs)), inputs=True)
        return inputs
    ```

    This method can also be called directly on a Functional Model during
    construction. In this case, any loss Tensors passed to this Model must
    be symbolic and be able to be traced back to the model's `Input`s. These
    losses become part of the model's topology and are tracked in `get_config`.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Actvity regularization.
    model.add_loss(tf.abs(tf.reduce_mean(x)))
    ```

    If this is not the case for your loss (if, for example, your loss references
    a `Variable` of one of the model's layers), you can wrap your loss in a
    zero-argument lambda. These losses are not tracked as part of the model's
    topology since they can't be serialized.

    Example:

    ```python
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
    # Weight regularization.
    model.add_loss(lambda: tf.reduce_mean(x.kernel))
    ```

    The `get_losses_for` method allows to retrieve the losses relevant to a
    specific set of inputs.

    Arguments:
      losses: Loss tensor, or list/tuple of tensors. Rather than tensors, losses
        may also be zero-argument callables which create a loss tensor.
      inputs: Ignored when executing eagerly. If anything other than None is
        passed, it signals the losses are conditional on some of the layer's
        inputs, and thus they should only be run where these inputs are
        available. This is the case for activity regularization losses, for
        instance. If `None` is passed, the losses are assumed
        to be unconditional, and will apply across all dataflows of the layer
        (e.g. weight regularization losses).
