(defn core-numpy-input-fn 
  "Returns input function that would feed dict of numpy arrays into the model.

  This returns a function outputting `features` and `targets` based on the dict
  of numpy arrays. The dict `features` has the same keys as the `x`. The dict
  `targets` has the same keys as the `y` if `y` is a dict.

  Example:

  ```python
  age = np.arange(4) * 1.0
  height = np.arange(32, 36)
  x = {'age': age, 'height': height}
  y = np.arange(-32, -28)

  with tf.Session() as session:
    input_fn = numpy_io.numpy_input_fn(
        x, y, batch_size=2, shuffle=False, num_epochs=1)
  ```

  Args:
    x: numpy array object or dict of numpy array objects. If an array,
      the array will be treated as a single feature.
    y: numpy array object or dict of numpy array object. `None` if absent.
    batch_size: Integer, size of batches to return.
    num_epochs: Integer, number of epochs to iterate over data. If `None` will
      run forever.
    shuffle: Boolean, if True shuffles the queue. Avoid shuffle at prediction
      time.
    queue_capacity: Integer, size of queue to accumulate.
    num_threads: Integer, number of threads used for reading and enqueueing. In
      order to have predicted and repeatable order of reading and enqueueing,
      such as in prediction and evaluation mode, `num_threads` should be 1.

  Returns:
    Function, that has signature of ()->(dict of `features`, `targets`)

  Raises:
    ValueError: if the shape of `y` mismatches the shape of values in `x` (i.e.,
      values in `x` have same shape).
    ValueError: if duplicate keys are in both `x` and `y` when `y` is a dict.
    ValueError: if x or y is an empty dict.
    TypeError: `x` is not a dict or array.
    ValueError: if 'shuffle' is not provided or a bool.

(defn deprecated 
  "Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.

  This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
  called. It has the following format:

    <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
    Instructions for updating:
    <instructions>

  If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
  <function> will include the class name if it is a method.

  It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
  to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
  to the rest of the docstring.

  Args:
    date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
      Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
    instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
      deprecated function.
    warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
      function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.

  Returns:
    Decorated function or method.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
      empty.
