(defn deprecated 
  "Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.

  This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
  called. It has the following format:

    <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
    Instructions for updating:
    <instructions>

  If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
  <function> will include the class name if it is a method.

  It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
  to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
  to the rest of the docstring.

  Args:
    date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
      Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
    instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
      deprecated function.
    warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
      function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.

  Returns:
    Decorated function or method.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
      empty.
