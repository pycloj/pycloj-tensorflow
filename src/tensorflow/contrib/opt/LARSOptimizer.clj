  "Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling for large batch training.

  Introduced by \"Large Batch Training of Convolutional Networks\" by Y. You,
  I. Gitman, and B. Ginsburg. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03888)

  Implements the LARS learning rate scheme presented in the paper above. This
  optimizer is useful when scaling the batch size to up to 32K without
  significant performance degradation. It is recommended to use the optimizer
  in conjunction with:
      - Gradual learning rate warm-up
      - Linear learning rate scaling
      - Poly rule learning rate decay

  Note, LARS scaling is currently only enabled for dense tensors. Sparse tensors
  use the default momentum optimizer.

(defn apply-gradients 
  "Apply gradients to variables.

    This is the second part of `minimize()`. It returns an `Operation` that
    applies gradients.

    Args:
      grads_and_vars: List of (gradient, variable) pairs as returned by
        `compute_gradients()`.
      global_step: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
        variables have been updated.
      name: Optional name for the returned operation.  Default to the
        name passed to the `Optimizer` constructor.

    Returns:
      An `Operation` that applies the specified gradients. If `global_step`
      was not None, that operation also increments `global_step`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `grads_and_vars` is malformed.
      ValueError: If none of the variables have gradients.
      RuntimeError: If you should use `_distributed_apply()` instead.

(defn compute-gradients 
  "Compute gradients of `loss` for the variables in `var_list`.

    This is the first part of `minimize()`.  It returns a list
    of (gradient, variable) pairs where \"gradient\" is the gradient
    for \"variable\".  Note that \"gradient\" can be a `Tensor`, an
    `IndexedSlices`, or `None` if there is no gradient for the
    given variable.

    Args:
      loss: A Tensor containing the value to minimize or a callable taking
        no arguments which returns the value to minimize. When eager execution
        is enabled it must be a callable.
      var_list: Optional list or tuple of `tf.Variable` to update to minimize
        `loss`.  Defaults to the list of variables collected in the graph
        under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.
      gate_gradients: How to gate the computation of gradients.  Can be
        `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, or `GATE_GRAPH`.
      aggregation_method: Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms.
        Valid values are defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.
      colocate_gradients_with_ops: If True, try colocating gradients with
        the corresponding op.
      grad_loss: Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.

    Returns:
      A list of (gradient, variable) pairs. Variable is always present, but
      gradient can be `None`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `var_list` contains anything else than `Variable` objects.
      ValueError: If some arguments are invalid.
      RuntimeError: If called with eager execution enabled and `loss` is
        not callable.

    Some `Optimizer` subclasses use additional variables.  For example

    gives access to these `Variable` objects if for some reason you need them.

    `Optimizer`.

    Args:
      var: A variable passed to `minimize()` or `apply_gradients()`.

(defn minimize 
  "Add operations to minimize `loss` by updating `var_list`.

    This method simply combines calls `compute_gradients()` and

    them call `compute_gradients()` and `apply_gradients()` explicitly instead
    of using this function.

    Args:
      loss: A `Tensor` containing the value to minimize.
      global_step: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
        variables have been updated.
      var_list: Optional list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to
        minimize `loss`.  Defaults to the list of variables collected in

      name: Optional name for the returned operation.
      grad_loss: Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.

    Returns:
      An Operation that updates the variables in `var_list`.  If `global_step`
      was not `None`, that operation also increments `global_step`.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If some of the variables are not `Variable` objects.

    @compatibility(eager)
    When eager execution is enabled, `loss` should be a Python function that
    takes no arguments and computes the value to be minimized. Minimization (and
    gradient computation) is done with respect to the elements of `var_list` if
    not None, else with respect to any trainable variables created during the
    execution of the `loss` function. `gate_gradients`, `aggregation_method`,
    `colocate_gradients_with_ops` and `grad_loss` are ignored when eager
    execution is enabled.
