  See: \"Efficient AUC Learning Curve Calculation\" by Bouckaert.

  This AUC Op updates in `O(batch_size + nbins)` time and works well even with

    scores:  1-D numeric `Tensor`, same shape as boolean_labels.
    score_range:  `Tensor` of shape `[2]`, same dtype as `scores`.  The min/max
      values of score that we expect.  Scores outside range will be clipped.
    nbins:  Integer number of bins to use.  Accuracy strictly increases as the
      number of bins increases.

  batch size and/or the number of evaluation steps is very large.

  Computes the area under the ROC curve and its confidence interval using

(defn cohen-kappa 
  "Calculates Cohen's kappa.

  [Cohen's kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen's_kappa) is a statistic
  that measures inter-annotator agreement.

  The `cohen_kappa` function calculates the confusion matrix, and creates three
  local variables to compute the Cohen's kappa: `po`, `pe_row`, and `pe_col`,
  which refer to the diagonal part, rows and columns totals of the confusion
  matrix, respectively. This value is ultimately returned as `kappa`, an
  idempotent operation that is calculated by

      pe = (pe_row * pe_col) / N
      k = (sum(po) - sum(pe)) / (N - sum(pe))

  For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
  `update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
  `kappa`. `update_op` weights each prediction by the corresponding value in
  `weights`.

  Class labels are expected to start at 0. E.g., if `num_classes`
  was three, then the possible labels would be [0, 1, 2].

  If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

    num_classes: The possible number of labels.
    weights: Optional `Tensor` whose shape matches `predictions`.

(defn f1-score 
  "Computes the approximately best F1-score across different thresholds.

  The f1_score function applies a range of thresholds to the predictions to
  convert them from [0, 1] to bool. Precision and recall are computed by
  comparing them to the labels. The F1-Score is then defined as
  2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall). The best one across the
  thresholds is returned.

  Disclaimer: In practice it may be desirable to choose the best threshold on
  the validation set and evaluate the F1 score with this threshold on a
  separate test set. Or it may be desirable to use a fixed threshold (e.g. 0.5).

  This function internally creates four local variables, `true_positives`,
  `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` that are used to
  compute the pairs of recall and precision values for a linearly spaced set of
  thresholds from which the best f1-score is derived.

  This value is ultimately returned as `f1-score`, an idempotent operation that
  computes the F1-score (computed using the aforementioned variables). The
  `num_thresholds` variable controls the degree of discretization with larger
  numbers of thresholds more closely approximating the true best F1-score.

  For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
  `update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the F1-score.

  Example usage with a custom estimator:
  def model_fn(features, labels, mode):
    predictions = make_predictions(features)

  These values are true positives, false negatives, true negatives, false
  positives, precision, and recall. This function returns a data structure that
  contains ops within it.

  Unlike _streaming_confusion_matrix_at_thresholds (which exhibits O(T * N)
  space and run time), this op exhibits O(T + N) space and run time, where T is
  the number of thresholds and N is the size of the predictions tensor. Hence,
  it may be advantageous to use this function when `predictions` is big.

  For instance, prefer this method for per-pixel classification tasks, for which
  the predictions tensor may be very large.

  Each number in `predictions`, a float in `[0, 1]`, is compared with its
  corresponding label in `labels`, and counts as a single tp/fp/tn/fn value at

  reweight certain values, or more commonly used for masking values.

(defn sparse-recall-at-top-k 
  "Computes recall@k of top-k predictions with respect to sparse labels.

  If `class_id` is specified, we calculate recall by considering only the
      entries in the batch for which `class_id` is in the label, and computing
      the fraction of them for which `class_id` is in the top-k `predictions`.
  If `class_id` is not specified, we'll calculate recall as how often on
      average a class among the labels of a batch entry is in the top-k
      `predictions`.

  `sparse_recall_at_top_k` creates two local variables, `true_positive_at_<k>`
  and `false_negative_at_<k>`, that are used to compute the recall_at_k
  frequency. This frequency is ultimately returned as `recall_at_<k>`: an
  idempotent operation that simply divides `true_positive_at_<k>` by total
  (`true_positive_at_<k>` + `false_negative_at_<k>`).

  For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
  `update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
  `recall_at_<k>`. Set operations applied to `top_k` and `labels` calculate the
  true positives and false negatives weighted by `weights`. Then `update_op`
  increments `true_positive_at_<k>` and `false_negative_at_<k>` using these
  values.

  If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

  Args:
    labels: `int64` `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` with shape [D1, ... DN,
      num_labels], where N >= 1 and num_labels is the number of target classes
      for the associated prediction. Commonly, N=1 and `labels` has shape
      [batch_size, num_labels]. [D1, ... DN] must match `top_k_predictions`.
      Values should be in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last
      dimension of `predictions`. Values outside this range always count towards
      `false_negative_at_<k>`.
    top_k_predictions: Integer `Tensor` with shape [D1, ... DN, k] where N >= 1.
      Commonly, N=1 and top_k_predictions has shape [batch size, k]. The final
      dimension contains the indices of top-k labels. [D1, ... DN] must match
      `labels`.
    class_id: Integer class ID for which we want binary metrics. This should be
      in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last dimension of
      `predictions`. If class_id is outside this range, the method returns NAN.
    weights: `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or n-1, where n is the rank of
      `labels`. If the latter, it must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all

Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.

The `streaming_accuracy` function creates two local variables, `total` and

matches `labels`. This frequency is ultimately returned as `accuracy`: an
idempotent operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.metrics.auc. Note that the order of the labels and predictions arguments has been switched.

The `streaming_auc` function creates four local variables, `true_positives`,
`true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` that are used to
compute the AUC. To discretize the AUC curve, a linearly spaced set of
thresholds is used to compute pairs of recall and precision values. The area
under the ROC-curve is therefore computed using the height of the recall
values by the false positive rate, while the area under the PR-curve is the
computed using the height of the precision values by the recall.

This value is ultimately returned as `auc`, an idempotent operation that
computes the area under a discretized curve of precision versus recall values
(computed using the aforementioned variables). The `num_thresholds` variable
controls the degree of discretization with larger numbers of thresholds more
closely approximating the true AUC. The quality of the approximation may vary
dramatically depending on `num_thresholds`.

For best results, `predictions` should be distributed approximately uniformly
in the range [0, 1] and not peaked around 0 or 1. The quality of the AUC
approximation may be poor if this is not the case.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an

(defn streaming-concat 
  "Concatenate values along an axis across batches.

  The function `streaming_concat` creates two local variables, `array` and

  used as storage for a dynamic array (if `maxsize` is `None`), which ensures
  that updates can be run in amortized constant time.

  For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
  `update_op` operation that appends the values of a tensor and returns the
  length of the concatenated axis.

  This op allows for evaluating metrics that cannot be updated incrementally

(defn streaming-covariance 
  "Computes the unbiased sample covariance between `predictions` and `labels`.

  The `streaming_covariance` function creates four local variables,
  `comoment`, `mean_prediction`, `mean_label`, and `count`, which are used to
  compute the sample covariance between predictions and labels across multiple
  batches of data. The covariance is ultimately returned as an idempotent
  operation that simply divides `comoment` by `count` - 1. We use `count` - 1
  in order to get an unbiased estimate.

  The algorithm used for this online computation is described in
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance.
  Specifically, the formula used to combine two sample comoments is
  `C_AB = C_A + C_B + (E[x_A] - E[x_B]) * (E[y_A] - E[y_B]) * n_A * n_B / n_AB`
  The comoment for a single batch of data is simply
  `sum((x - E[x]) * (y - E[y]))`, optionally weighted.

  If `weights` is not None, then it is used to compute weighted comoments,
  means, and count. NOTE: these weights are treated as \"frequency weights\", as
  opposed to \"reliability weights\". See discussion of the difference on
  https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance

  To facilitate the computation of covariance across multiple batches of data,
  the function creates an `update_op` operation, which updates underlying
  variables and returns the updated covariance.

    weights: Optional `Tensor` indicating the frequency with which an example is

In contrast to the `streaming_mean` function which returns a scalar with the
mean,  this function returns an average tensor with the same shape as the
input tensors.

The `streaming_mean_tensor` function creates two local variables,
`total_tensor` and `count_tensor` that are used to compute the average of
`values`. This average is ultimately returned as `mean` which is an idempotent
operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean`.
`update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the product of `values`
and `weights`, and it increments `count` with the reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.
