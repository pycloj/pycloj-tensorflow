    This is called to signal the hooks that a new session has been created. This
    has two essential differences with the situation in which `begin` is called:

    * When this is called, the graph is finalized and ops can no longer be added
        to the graph.
    * This method will also be called as a result of recovering a wrapped
        session, not only at the beginning of the overall session.

      session: A TensorFlow Session that has been created.

    When called, the default graph is the one that will be launched in the
    session.  The hook can modify the graph by adding new operations to it.
    After the `begin()` call the graph will be finalized and the other callbacks
    can not modify the graph anymore. Second call of `begin()` on the same

    The `session` argument can be used in case the hook wants to run final ops,
    such as saving a last checkpoint.

    If `session.run()` raises exception other than OutOfRangeError or
    StopIteration then `end()` is not called.
    Note the difference between `end()` and `after_run()` behavior when
    `session.run()` raises OutOfRangeError or StopIteration. In that case
    `end()` is called but `after_run()` is not called.
