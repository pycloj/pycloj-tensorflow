(defn odeint 
  "Integrate a system of ordinary differential equations.

  Solves the initial value problem for a non-stiff system of first order ODEs:

    ```
    dy/dt = func(y, t), y(t[0]) = y0
    ```

  where y is a Tensor of any shape.

  For example:

    ```
    # solve `dy/dt = -y`, corresponding to exponential decay
    tf.contrib.integrate.odeint(lambda y, _: -y, 1.0, [0, 1, 2])
    => [1, exp(-1), exp(-2)]
    ```

  Output dtypes and numerical precision are based on the dtypes of the inputs
  `y0` and `t`.

  Currently, implements 5th order Runge-Kutta with adaptive step size control
  and dense output, using the Dormand-Prince method. Similar to the 'dopri5'
  method of `scipy.integrate.ode` and MATLAB's `ode45`.

  Based on: Shampine, Lawrence F. (1986), \"Some Practical Runge-Kutta Formulas\",
  Mathematics of Computation, American Mathematical Society, 46 (173): 135-150,
  doi:10.2307/2008219

  Args:
    func: Function that maps a Tensor holding the state `y` and a scalar Tensor
      `t` into a Tensor of state derivatives with respect to time.
    y0: N-D Tensor giving starting value of `y` at time point `t[0]`. May
      have any floating point or complex dtype.
    t: 1-D Tensor holding a sequence of time points for which to solve for
      `y`. The initial time point should be the first element of this sequence,
      and each time must be larger than the previous time. May have any floating
      point dtype. If not provided as a Tensor, converted to a Tensor with
      float64 dtype.
    rtol: optional float64 Tensor specifying an upper bound on relative error,
      per element of `y`.
    atol: optional float64 Tensor specifying an upper bound on absolute error,
      per element of `y`.
    method: optional string indicating the integration method to use. Currently,
      the only valid option is `'dopri5'`.
    options: optional dict of configuring options for the indicated integration
      method. Can only be provided if a `method` is explicitly set. For
      `'dopri5'`, valid options include:
      * first_step: an initial guess for the size of the first integration
        (current default: 1.0, but may later be changed to use heuristics based
        on the gradient).
      * safety: safety factor for adaptive step control, generally a constant
        in the range 0.8-1 (default: 0.9).
      * ifactor: maximum factor by which the adaptive step may be increased
        (default: 10.0).
      * dfactor: maximum factor by which the adpative step may be decreased
        (default: 0.2).
      * max_num_steps: integer maximum number of integrate steps between time
        points in `t` (default: 1000).
    full_output: optional boolean. If True, `odeint` returns a tuple
      `(y, info_dict)` describing the integration process.
    name: Optional name for this operation.

  Returns:
    y: (N+1)-D tensor, where the first dimension corresponds to different
      time points. Contains the solved value of y for each desired time point in
      `t`, with the initial value `y0` being the first element along the first
      dimension.
    info_dict: only if `full_output == True`. A dict with the following values:
      * num_func_evals: integer Tensor counting the number of function
        evaluations.
      * integrate_points: 1D float64 Tensor with the upper bound of each
        integration time step.
      * error_ratio: 1D float Tensor with the estimated ratio of the integration
        error to the error tolerance at each integration step. An ratio greater
        than 1 corresponds to rejected steps.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if an invalid `method` is provided.
    TypeError: if `options` is supplied without `method`, or if `t` or `y0` has
      an invalid dtype.

(defn odeint-fixed 
  "ODE integration on a fixed grid (with no step size control).

  Useful in certain scenarios to avoid the overhead of adaptive step size
  control, e.g. when differentiation of the integration result is desired and/or
  the time grid is known a priori to be sufficient.

  Args:
    func: Function that maps a Tensor holding the state `y` and a scalar Tensor
      `t` into a Tensor of state derivatives with respect to time.
    y0: N-D Tensor giving starting value of `y` at time point `t[0]`.
    t: 1-D Tensor holding a sequence of time points for which to solve for
      `y`. The initial time point should be the first element of this sequence,
      and each time must be larger than the previous time. May have any floating
      point dtype.
    dt: 0-D or 1-D Tensor providing time step suggestion to be used on time
      integration intervals in `t`. 1-D Tensor should provide values
      for all intervals, must have 1 less element than that of `t`.
      If given a 0-D Tensor, the value is interpreted as time step suggestion
      same for all intervals. If passed None, then time step is set to be the
      t[1:] - t[:-1]. Defaults to None. The actual step size is obtained by
      insuring an integer number of steps per interval, potentially reducing the
      time step.
    method: One of 'midpoint' or 'rk4'.
    name: Optional name for the resulting operation.

  Returns:
    y: (N+1)-D tensor, where the first dimension corresponds to different
      time points. Contains the solved value of y for each desired time point in
      `t`, with the initial value `y0` being the first element along the first
      dimension.

  Raises:
    ValueError: Upon caller errors.
