(ns tensorflow.-api.v1.compat.v1.train.MonitoredSession
  "Session-like object that handles initialization, recovery and hooks.

  Example usage:

  ```python
  saver_hook = CheckpointSaverHook(...)
  summary_hook = SummarySaverHook(...)
  with MonitoredSession(session_creator=ChiefSessionCreator(...),
                        hooks=[saver_hook, summary_hook]) as sess:
    while not sess.should_stop():
      sess.run(train_op)
  ```

  Initialization: At creation time the monitored session does following things
  in given order:

  * calls `hook.begin()` for each given hook
  * finalizes the graph via `scaffold.finalize()`
  * create session
  * initializes the model via initialization ops provided by `Scaffold`
  * restores variables if a checkpoint exists
  * launches queue runners
  * calls `hook.after_create_session()`

  Run: When `run()` is called, the monitored session does following things:

  * calls `hook.before_run()`
  * calls TensorFlow `session.run()` with merged fetches and feed_dict
  * calls `hook.after_run()`
  * returns result of `session.run()` asked by user
  * if `AbortedError` or `UnavailableError` occurs, it recovers or
    reinitializes the session before executing the run() call again


  Exit: At the `close()`, the monitored session does following things in order:

  * calls `hook.end()`
  * closes the queue runners and the session
  * suppresses `OutOfRange` error which indicates that all inputs have been
    processed if the monitored_session is used as a context

  How to set `tf.compat.v1.Session` arguments:

  * In most cases you can set session arguments as follows:

  ```python
  MonitoredSession(
    session_creator=ChiefSessionCreator(master=..., config=...))
  ```

  * In distributed setting for a non-chief worker, you can use following:

  ```python
  MonitoredSession(
    session_creator=WorkerSessionCreator(master=..., config=...))
  ```

  See `MonitoredTrainingSession` for an example usage based on chief or worker.

  Note: This is not a `tf.compat.v1.Session`. For example, it cannot do
  following:

  * it cannot be set as default session.
  * it cannot be sent to saver.save.
  * it cannot be sent to tf.train.start_queue_runners.

  Args:
    session_creator: A factory object to create session. Typically a
      `ChiefSessionCreator` which is the default one.
    hooks: An iterable of `SessionRunHook' objects.

  Returns:
    A MonitoredSession object.

(defn run-step-fn 
  "Run ops using a step function.

    Args:
      step_fn: A function or a method with a single argument of type
        `StepContext`.  The function may use methods of the argument to perform
        computations with access to a raw session.  The returned value of the
        `step_fn` will be returned from `run_step_fn`, unless a stop is
        requested.  In that case, the next `should_stop` call will return True.
        Example usage:
            ```python
            with tf.Graph().as_default():
              c = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtypes.float32)
              v = tf.add(c, 4.0)
              w = tf.add(c, 0.5)
              def step_fn(step_context):
                a = step_context.session.run(fetches=v, feed_dict={c: 0.5})
                if a <= 4.5:

              with tf.MonitoredSession() as session:
                while not session.should_stop():
                  a = session.run_step_fn(step_fn)
            ```
            Hooks interact with the `run_with_hooks()` call inside the
                 `step_fn` as they do with a `MonitoredSession.run` call.

    Returns:
      Returns the returned value of `step_fn`.

    Raises:
      StopIteration: if `step_fn` has called `request_stop()`.  It may be
        caught by `with tf.MonitoredSession()` to close the session.
      ValueError: if `step_fn` doesn't have a single argument called
        `step_context`. It may also optionally have `self` for cases when it
        belongs to an object.
