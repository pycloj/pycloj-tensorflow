(ns tensorflow.-api.v1.compat.v1.train.AdagradDAOptimizer
  "Adagrad Dual Averaging algorithm for sparse linear models.

  See this [paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/duchi11a/duchi11a.pdf).

  This optimizer takes care of regularization of unseen features in a mini batch
  by updating them when they are seen with a closed form update rule that is
  equivalent to having updated them on every mini-batch.

  AdagradDA is typically used when there is a need for large sparsity in the
  trained model. This optimizer only guarantees sparsity for linear models. Be
  careful when using AdagradDA for deep networks as it will require careful
  initialization of the gradient accumulators for it to train.

  "Apply gradients to variables.

    This is the second part of `minimize()`. It returns an `Operation` that
    applies gradients.

    Args:
      grads_and_vars: List of (gradient, variable) pairs as returned by
        `compute_gradients()`.
      global_step: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
        variables have been updated.
      name: Optional name for the returned operation.  Default to the
        name passed to the `Optimizer` constructor.

    Returns:
      An `Operation` that applies the specified gradients. If `global_step`
      was not None, that operation also increments `global_step`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `grads_and_vars` is malformed.

(defn compute-gradients 
  "Compute gradients of `loss` for the variables in `var_list`.

    This is the first part of `minimize()`.  It returns a list
    of (gradient, variable) pairs where \"gradient\" is the gradient
    for \"variable\".  Note that \"gradient\" can be a `Tensor`, an
    `IndexedSlices`, or `None` if there is no gradient for the
    given variable.

    Args:
      loss: A Tensor containing the value to minimize or a callable taking
        no arguments which returns the value to minimize. When eager execution
        is enabled it must be a callable.
      var_list: Optional list or tuple of `tf.Variable` to update to minimize
        `loss`.  Defaults to the list of variables collected in the graph
        under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.
      gate_gradients: How to gate the computation of gradients.  Can be
        `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, or `GATE_GRAPH`.
      aggregation_method: Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms.
        Valid values are defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.
      colocate_gradients_with_ops: If True, try colocating gradients with
        the corresponding op.
      grad_loss: Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.

    Returns:
      A list of (gradient, variable) pairs. Variable is always present, but
      gradient can be `None`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `var_list` contains anything else than `Variable` objects.
      ValueError: If some arguments are invalid.

    Args:

  "Add operations to minimize `loss` by updating `var_list`.

    This method simply combines calls `compute_gradients()` and

    of using this function.

    Args:
      loss: A `Tensor` containing the value to minimize.
      global_step: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
        variables have been updated.
      var_list: Optional list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to
        minimize `loss`.  Defaults to the list of variables collected in

      name: Optional name for the returned operation.
      grad_loss: Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.

    Returns:
      An Operation that updates the variables in `var_list`.  If `global_step`
      was not `None`, that operation also increments `global_step`.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If some of the variables are not `Variable` objects.

    @compatibility(eager)
    When eager execution is enabled, `loss` should be a Python function that
    takes no arguments and computes the value to be minimized. Minimization (and
    gradient computation) is done with respect to the elements of `var_list` if
    not None, else with respect to any trainable variables created during the
    execution of the `loss` function. `gate_gradients`, `aggregation_method`,
    `colocate_gradients_with_ops` and `grad_loss` are ignored when eager
    execution is enabled.
