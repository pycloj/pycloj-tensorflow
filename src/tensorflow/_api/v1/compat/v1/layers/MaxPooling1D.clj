  "Add update op(s), potentially dependent on layer inputs. (deprecated arguments)

Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(inputs)`. They will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
`inputs` is now automatically inferred

Weight updates (for instance, the updates of the moving mean and variance
in a BatchNormalization layer) may be dependent on the inputs passed
when calling a layer. Hence, when reusing the same layer on
different inputs `a` and `b`, some entries in `layer.updates` may be
dependent on `a` and some on `b`. This method automatically keeps track
of dependencies.

The `get_updates_for` method allows to retrieve the updates relevant to a
specific set of inputs.

This call is ignored when eager execution is enabled (in that case, variable
updates are run on the fly and thus do not need to be tracked for later
execution).

Arguments:
  updates: Update op, or list/tuple of update ops, or zero-arg callable
    that returns an update op. A zero-arg callable should be passed in
    order to disable running the updates by setting `trainable=False`
    on this Layer, when executing in Eager mode.

    Arguments:

      dtype: The type of the variable. Defaults to `self.dtype` or `float32`.
      initializer: initializer instance (callable).
      regularizer: regularizer instance (callable).
      trainable: whether the variable should be part of the layer's
        \"trainable_variables\" (e.g. variables, biases)
        or \"non_trainable_variables\" (e.g. BatchNorm mean, stddev).
        Note, if the current variable scope is marked as non-trainable
        then this parameter is ignored and any added variables are also
        marked as non-trainable. `trainable` defaults to `True` unless
        `synchronization` is set to `ON_READ`.
      constraint: constraint instance (callable).
      use_resource: Whether to use `ResourceVariable`.
      synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be
        aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
        `tf.VariableSynchronization`. By default the synchronization is set to
        `AUTO` and the current `DistributionStrategy` chooses
        when to synchronize. If `synchronization` is set to `ON_READ`,
        `trainable` must not be set to `True`.
      aggregation: Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.
        Accepted values are constants defined in the class
        `tf.VariableAggregation`.
      partitioner: (optional) partitioner instance (callable).  If
        provided, when the requested variable is created it will be split
        into multiple partitions according to `partitioner`.  In this case,
        an instance of `PartitionedVariable` is returned.  Available
        partitioners include `tf.compat.v1.fixed_size_partitioner` and

        the documentation of `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` and the  \"Variable

      **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

    Returns:

      instance.  If `partitioner` is not `None`, a `PartitionedVariable`
      instance is returned.
