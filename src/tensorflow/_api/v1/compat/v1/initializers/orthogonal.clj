(ns tensorflow.-api.v1.compat.v1.initializers.orthogonal
  "Initializer that generates an orthogonal matrix.

  If the shape of the tensor to initialize is two-dimensional, it is initialized
  with an orthogonal matrix obtained from the QR decomposition of a matrix of
  random numbers drawn from a normal distribution.
  If the matrix has fewer rows than columns then the output will have orthogonal
  rows. Otherwise, the output will have orthogonal columns.

  If the shape of the tensor to initialize is more than two-dimensional,
  a matrix of shape `(shape[0] * ... * shape[n - 2], shape[n - 1])`
  is initialized, where `n` is the length of the shape vector.
  The matrix is subsequently reshaped to give a tensor of the desired shape.

  Args:
    gain: multiplicative factor to apply to the orthogonal matrix
    seed: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See
      `tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed` for behavior.
    dtype: Default data type, used if no `dtype` argument is provided when
      calling the initializer. Only floating point types are supported.
